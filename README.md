Database Systems Fall 2025 Project

The main goal is to create a database that stores a bunch of information on different cupcake flavors and their ingredients. Our advanced "flavor profiler" that will guide users to their ideal cupcake based on their personal taste preferences. The personalized flavor recommendations will be formed with an advanced decision tree that guides our user based on preferences and allergies.
